# COIS 3430 - Assignment #1

The focus of this assignment is the PHP skills covered in the first few weeks of the course. That being said, you will still need to write proper HTML (sematic, accessible and valid) where necessary to complete the tasks, and are still expected to use CSS to present your solution in a way that looks polished and improves readability/usability.

## General Assignment Things to Note

- You cannot use the W3C file upload to validate HTML generated by PHP. You will need to load the page in a browser, copy the page source and paste it ito the direct input version.
- Remember that the only place on Loki you can move files to is the **www_data** folder, although you shouldn't need to save any files, since question one does not require you to keep the uploaded file.
- You should capitalize on using includes and separate the overall design (header, footer, nav) into include files to be able to include it on multiple pages without repetition.
- Despite PHP being a loosely typed scripting language, you are expected to use traditional good coding behaviors like documentation and the use of functions where appropriate.

## Question #1

This question is designed to have you work with files, as well as string and array manipulation in PHP.

You should start with a simple form containing a _textbox_ for an _optional_ search term, and a _file upload_ which allows them to upload a file which contains multiple lines of text (with the file each line should be treated as a separate string).

For the text file you will have multiple sets of the output below, one corresponding to each line in the file.

You don't actually need to save the file the user uploads, you can process it right from it's temp location.

**Although many of the tasks below can be accomplished with regular expressions, the point of the assignment is to practice basic string functions, so the use of regular expressions is forbidden**

On submission of the form, you should output following for each line in the file:

- The **original string** (formatted in a way to make it obvious it's the start of that output)
- The number of **words** in the string.
- The number of **letter a**'s in each string
- The **number of common punctuation characters** in each string. For this assignment, we are are considering punctuation to be characters with an ascii value between 33-47, 58-64, 91-96 and 123-126.
- The string re-ordered so the words are in **descending alphabetical order** (irrespective of case).
- The **middle-third characters** of the string, if the string isn't evenly divisible by three, you should take the lower value. _Example: if the string is 15 characters long, you would output characters 6-10, if it's 16 or 17 characters, you would still output character 6-10_

After you've output the data for individual lines:

- **Searching:**, if a search term is provided re-output only the strings that contain the search term (with the search term highlighted - you'll need wrap it in HTML with class) and a count of the number of strings that did not have the term.

Part of your testing process will be to create a text file to use that **thoroughly** tests that your above code works. Be sure to include that test file in your git repo.

## Question #2

Use PHP to create a 5 question online multiple choice quiz about a subject of your choice. Although there are more elegant solutions, for the sake of this exercise, each question should appear on its own (self-processing) page.

On submission of a question, the page should check the userâ€™s answer and store feedback (including the correct answer if they got it wrong) in a feedback array in SESSION.

On completion of the quiz you should output the feedback for each question (correct answers should be stylistically different then incorrect ones), the userâ€™s score, and a summary feedback message based on their score.

_There will be marks for the originality of your subject matter_

## Question #3

Write a sticky, self-processing PHP page that implements a game of paper, scissors, rock, where the user can play until they lose 10 times, and their number of wins can be added to an arcade game style "high scores" table.

_If you're a Big Bang Theory fan, feel free to modify the subject accordingly if you want. ðŸ––_

### The Game Page

The game page should show the current game number, the users number of wins and losses so far, a place for a feedback message, a button/link allowing them to start again, and the form containing paper/scissors/rock buttons that allows for game interaction.

_You'll need to distinguish between the page being loaded from a url (which is always a GET), and the page being loaded because of form submit (which should be POST), so that you know when to initialize your game/win/loss variables to 0._

Each time a choice is submitted, the program should randomly choose paper/scissors/rock, and determine if the user has won or lost.

It should update the appropriate sessions variables for wins/losses/game number, and output a message with the game number, the computers choice, the users choice, and an indicator if this means the user won or lost.

If the user has lost 10-times they should be directed to the Game Over page (note: they won't see feedback for this game and that's fine).

### The Game Over Page

This page should indicate to the user that their game is over. It should give them an option to enter their name and email to save their score to the high scores table. This should also be a self-processing form, and on submission, should validate the name and email, and then write the users name, email and score to the database (in a table you've created for this assignment). It should then redirect the user to the High Scores page.

### The High Scores Page

The high scores page should display the top 20 scores and names (but not email) in the database, nicely formatted in descending order. It should also provide a link where the user can play again. Keep in mind that the high scores table is arcade style, so a user could hold all the spots on the table.

### General Question 3 Info

- The "Play Again" and "High Scores" options can be part of a site navigation rather then part of the individual pages to make them accessible from every where

## Submission

- Verify that your git repo is up-to-date online.
- Your testing document should be complied in the provided .md file. Please be sure to put your testing screenshots in the provided _testing-screenshots_ folder so they do not get uploaded to Loki and fill your disk quota.
- Submit a link to your github repo, and a link to the first page of each question on Loki on Blackboard.

Every business knows its consumers' relationship can be improved by the means of all kinds of digital marketing instruments. However, it goes without saying that digital advertising is also burdened with real ethical issues, especially regarding data protection and the level of transparency. With the growing tendency to employ artificial intelligence and big data to market goods and services it appears that come data indirection and data exploitation. The Collaboration of the Customer in New Consumption – as people now become care about how their data is gathered and used, the need for ethical norms in presence of data protection, security and transparency is created (Ethical Issues in Digital Marketing – A Review, 2018).

The deception of consumers using false claims is regarded as one of the important ethical issues in digital marketing. Promoted Targeted ADs based on AI might sometimes contain inaccurate information, making potentially unfounded claims. This erodes the trust of consumers. It is extremely important that marketers always use truthful advertisements, and that they do not mislead consumers with spin (Nelson & Simek, 2013). As well as that, that which proliferates in the current environment, the endorsement of products by social media strangers, demands the disclosure of ‘paid to promote’ claims in order to avoid the pederast of audiences’ goodwill. Consumers may be misled as a result of deficiencies in disclosure, hence the reason for having codes of ethics is to encourage transparency and take responsibility for one’s actions.

To deal with these problems, it is necessary for companies to incorporate ethical measures including informing consumers about the data privacy policy, seeking permission from the client or customer, and behaving truthfully with advertisement. Adopting such agreements will not only respect the rights of consumers but also improve the standing of a brand which in turn encourages customer retention (Sharma et al., 2024).
